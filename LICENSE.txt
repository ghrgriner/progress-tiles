License for Python code in this package
---------------------------------------
The code for creating the coordinates for 'hat' tiles (src/hat.py,
src/hat_config.txt, src/hat_tiling.txt, and similary for files with
'hat2' in the name) is provided under the MIT license. The same is
true for the honeycomb example (src/honeycomb.py,
src/honeycomb_tiling.txt). 

The other *.py file (src/show_progress.py) is licensed under the
GNU General Public License v3. See LICENSE_GPL_v3_for_other_py_files.txt
in the src/ directory for the license.

License and attribution information for hat tiling
-------------------------------------------------------------
Images based on the 'hat' tiling [1] are made available under
the CC BY-SA 4.0 license by the authors, and we release
our modifications under the same license.

[1] Smith D, Myers JS, Kaplan CS, Goodman-Strauss C. An aperiodic monotile. Combinatorial Theory, 4(1):1-91.

Two images in particular are used.

The image used by src/hat.py which generates coordinates in
src/hat_tiling.txt is a screenshot of a looping animation by the
authors that loops between the chevron, comet, and other continuum
of tiles. This image is then slightly modified for use. The colors
are similar but not identical and the vertical alignment is similar but
probably not identical to the original image.

The second image used by src/hat2.py which generates coordinates in
src/hat2_tiling.txt is a recreation of patch647.png. Here, the color
scheme is changed to be similar to the first image.

This program can also be configured to modify the images in other
ways, such as changing the fill color, border color, or transparency
of each tile. The window that displays the image may crop the image
depending on the window dimensions selected by the user.

The webpage with the images is: https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/hat/. 

The link to the GIF used is: https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/hat/examples/animation.gif
The link to the second image is: https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/hat/examples/patch647.png
