License and attribution information for hat tiling
-------------------------------------------------------------
Images based on the 'hat' tiling [1] are made available under
the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.

The image in particular used is a screenshot of a looping
animation by the authors that loops between the chevron, comet,
and other continuum of tiles. This image is then slightly modified
for use. The colors are similar but not identical, when the image
is displayed in the app it may be cropped, tiles with only a
small portion visible in the original image may be omitted, and
the vertical alignment is similar but probably not identical to the
original image.

This program can also be configured to modify the image in other
ways, such as changing the fill color, border color, or transparency
of each tile.
