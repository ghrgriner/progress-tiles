License for Python code in this package
---------------------------------------
The code for creating the coordinates for the example tilings
(src/hatlike.py, src/hat2.py, src/hat_config.txt, src/hat2_config.txt,
src/honeycomb.py) and the generated coordinate files ending in _tiling.txt
are provided under the MIT license. However, see the next section for
the license and attribution requirement for the generated images.

The other *.py file (src/show_progress.py) is licensed under the
GNU General Public License v3. See LICENSE_GPL_v3_for_other_py_files.txt
in the src/ directory for the license.

License and attribution information for hat tiling
-------------------------------------------------------------
Images based on the 'hat' tiling [1] or tiles in the same family
are made available under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license by the authors,
and we release our modifications under the same license. (We use
the term hat-family to refer to the continuum of tiles described
by the authors in their manuscript, e.g., in their Figure 2.3.)

[1] Smith D, Myers JS, Kaplan CS, Goodman-Strauss C. An aperiodic monotile. Combinatorial Theory, 4(1):1-91.

Two images in particular are used.

The source images for src/hatlike.py which generates coordinates in
hat_tiling.txt, tile_10_1_tiling.txt, tile_4_1_tiling.txt, turtle_tiling.txt,
tile_1_1_tiling.txt, tile_1_4_tiling.txt, tile_1_10_tiling.txt,
comet_tiling.txt, and chevron_tiling.txt
are similar to screenshots of a looping animation by the
authors that loops along the continuum of tiles between the chevron and
comet described in the authors' manuscript. This image is then slightly
modified for use. The colors are similar but not identical and the vertical
alignment is similar but probably not identical to the original image.

The second image used by src/hat2.py which generates coordinates in
src/hat2_tiling.txt is a recreation of patch647.png. Here, the color
scheme is changed to be similar to the first set of images.

This program can also be configured to modify the images in other
ways, such as changing the fill color, border color, or transparency
of each tile.

For both sets of images, the window that displays the image may crop the
image depending on the window dimensions selected by the user.

The webpage with the images is: https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/hat/.
